# Climate-Change
All my code on the climate change research project for Santa Clara 

The folder named "Percent Difference in Prec" has all of my final data for the Percent Difference (The graph with 6 boxplots per quantile)

The folder named "Non-Exceedence All" has all of the data (historical, midcentury, difference, and percent difference) for BCSD and LOCA

The folder named "Monthly Data" has the final data for the monthly values, showing station 34 and 77 (graph with 4 boxplots for each month)

The folder named "BCSD versus LOCA Ellipse" has the final data for the comparison between the yearly data for BCSD and LOCA (ellipse graph)
